# Predicting Drilling Performance Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on using machine learning to predict key drilling parameters, such as ROP (Rate of Penetration), BIT_RPM, MWI, and others, based on the PP Zamora Method. By using data preprocessing techniques and regression models, the project provides accurate predictions that can optimize drilling operations, reduce costs, and improve decision-making in real-time.
